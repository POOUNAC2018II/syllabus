Course Description

Learn best practices in JavaScript in this intensive, five-session course. Topics include data encapsulation, closures, binding, inheritance, and name spacing. Discover some of the lesser-known, yet useful, features of the language, such as how to debug JavaScript problems on different browsers and improve performance. Create interactive webpages using third-party JavaScript libraries.

Computers are provided in the lab, though you are encouraged to bring a laptop for in-class exercises.
Prerequisites

    INFO1-CE9755 - JavaScript (syllabus) or equivalent
    Understanding of variables, data types, control flow, and basic function usage in JavaScript
    Strong intermediate knowledge of HTML, and at least basics of CSS
    Basic jQuery knowledge (DOM interaction like adding/removing elements/classes, etc.)

These won't be enforced by the instructor, but you will be pretty lost without understanding those concepts. If you need a refresher, take a look at the Beginner Materials.
Course Overview

We will dive into the nuances of JavaScript, how prototypal inheritance compares to classical inheritance, and how this can be used to build dynamic and complex web applications. Modern tools like jQuery and BackboneJS will be discussed, but students will learn the building blocks of these frameworks and after this course be able to understand what is happening under the hood. The focus will be on development for browsers, though most applies to other systems like Node.js, Phonegap, etc. Topics covered include:

    Encapsulation, closures and scope
    Classical vs. prototypal inheritance
    The event loop
    AJAX and JSONP
        local
        remote (e.g. Foursquare)
    Creating MVC-style models (a'la Backbone.js) from scratch
    Test- and Pseudocode-Driven Development

Topics will be demonstrated through live-code examples/slides, available at advanced-js.github.io/deck. Additional exercises will completed in-class.
